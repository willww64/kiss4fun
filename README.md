Keep It Simple, Scripted, and just for Fun.

This project is a collection of scripts I wrote in my spare time. These scripts are for fun, learning and demonstration purpose.

There are 3 main types of scripts:

1. toy versions of popular programs that reimplemented in pure bash scripts
1. useful scripts to manage something
1. a bunch of messy and useless scripts


Currently implemented:

- `etcd`, one of the most popular KV store - [`duck-etcd`](./duck-etcd) (WIP)
- `flannel`, one of the most popular network plugin for `K8s` - [ragged-flannel](./ragged-flannel) (WIP)
