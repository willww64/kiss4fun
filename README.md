Keep It Simple, Scripted, and just for Fun.

This project is a collection of scripts I wrote in my spare time. These scripts are for fun, learning and demonstration purpose.

There are 3 main types of scripts:

1. toy versions of popular programs that reimplemented in pure bash scripts
1. useful scripts to manage something
1. a bunch of messy and useless scripts


Currently implemented:

- [duck-etcd](./duck-etcd) (WIP) `etcd`-like KV store implemented in pure bash.
- [ragged-flannel](./ragged-flannel) (WIP), a pure bash implementation of `flannel`
- [vm](./vm), a very simple, barely usable `qemu/kvm` virtual machine manager.
    You can define multiple VMs in one `vmfile`, which is similar to `Vagrantfile`.
- [wgmgr](./wgmgr), a simple `wireguard` VPN server management script
