Keep It Simple, Scripted, and just for Fun.

This project is a collection of toy versions of popular programs that I have reimplemented in pure bash scripts.
I did this for fun, learning and demonstration purpose.

Currently implemented programs:

- `etcd`, one of the most popular KV store - [`duck-etcd`](./duck-etcd) (WIP)
- `flannel`, one of the most popular network plugin for `K8s` - [ragged-flannel](./ragged-flannel) (COMING SOON)
